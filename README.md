### ES3ink is board design to control e-ink displays. 

This repo hold HW and SW (to be done) information for this board.

Board is mostly working, but still have some issues so **I do not recommend** to make it.   

It can be used with either Arduino or [CircuitPython](https://github.com/dronecz/circuitpython).
